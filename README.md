## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- PNPM 8+

### Installation & Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/chalkline.ai.git
cd chalkline.ai

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:5173
```

The application will start with:
- **Studio Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **LLM Gateway**: http://localhost:3001

### Available Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev          # Start all development servers
pnpm build        # Build all packages for production
pnpm test         # Run all tests
pnpm lint         # Lint all packages
pnpm typecheck    # Type check all packages

# Individual packages
pnpm --filter studio dev      # Studio frontend only
pnpm --filter gateway dev     # LLM Gateway only
pnpm --filter policy build    # Policy package only
```

## 📚 Core Features Demo

### 1. AI Policy System
Our revolutionary AI policy engine prevents cheating while encouraging learning:

```typescript
// Example policy decision
const mode = decideResponseMode(
  "What's the answer to x² - 5x + 6 = 0?",
  assignment,
  submission
);
// Returns: "TRY_FIRST" if no attempt, "HINTS_ONLY" if attempted
```

**Policy Modes:**
- `TRY_FIRST`: Student must attempt before getting help
- `HINTS_ONLY`: Provides guidance without direct answers
- `NORM_CHAT`: General questions not related to assignments

### 2. Multi-Modal Work Environment
Students can seamlessly switch between:
- **Document Editor**: TipTap-powered rich text with AI assistance
- **PDF Annotator**: Highlight, comment, and draw on documents  
- **Digital Whiteboard**: Shape recognition and AI-enhanced diagrams

### 3. Real-Time Learning Analytics
Teachers see instant insights:
- Time spent on each question
- Number of AI interactions
- Revision patterns and engagement metrics
- Early warning system for struggling students

## 🧪 Educational Philosophy

### "Help, Don't Do" Approach
1. **Student Attempts First**: AI requires genuine effort before providing guidance
2. **Socratic Method**: Leading questions instead of direct answers
3. **Resource Direction**: Points to learning materials and explanations
4. **Process Focus**: Values thinking and methodology over final answers

### Privacy & Ethics First
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only what's needed for educational outcomes
- **Transparent AI**: Students understand when and how AI assists them
- **Teacher Control**: Educators maintain authority over assessment and feedback
- **Student Agency**: Learners can opt out of AI assistance at any time
